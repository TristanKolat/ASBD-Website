                       "I worked with Bev Miller and her “A Sign By Design” company over 30+ years in the 
                       Indianapolis Commercial Real Estate Industry. Bev and her team started off as a vendor, 
                       then also became our design partner as she helped us create “Signage Standards” for every building in our 
                       Indy Portfolio of 100+ buildings. This helped us streamline all signage design approvals on a tenant by tenant basis. 
                       Bev has many incredible qualities such as Integrity, Honesty, Diligent, Timely & Efficient. I would highly recommend 
                       Bev and her team to bid and complete any signage project you are contemplating as she will move the project from start to finish 
                       in a very creative, yet cost effective & on time."
